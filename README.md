# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Analysis-Forecasting
This project explores and predicts daily bike-sharing demand using historical rental and weather data. It applies data science techniques to uncover demand patterns and improve operational planning.
Key features:

EDA & Visualization: Analyzed trends, seasonality, weather impact, and holiday effects on demand.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned missing values, handled outliers, created engineered features (e.g., temp bins, day types).

Predictive Modeling: Built and compared Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost models.

Power BI Integration: Developed dashboards to visualize rental patterns and forecasted demand.

Insights: Identified key demand drivers to recommend strategies for optimizing bike availability.

Repository includes Jupyter notebooks, cleaned datasets, Power BI files, and documentation.
